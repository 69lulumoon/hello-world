    This X Does Not Exist is a website that links to numerous other websites that will generate images of things, humans or animals that do not exist. This website is noteworthy for its use of unsophisticated Ai image generation as the websites all utilize outdated AI technology. In a sense it is a time capsule that allows the visitor to look back at a time where AI was still new and rough around the edges.</p>

    Species In Pieces is an informative website that ceatively showcases thirty animals in danger of extinction. Each animal is built with thirty polygonal pieces and the UI allows the viewer to learn more about the website and the animal that is currently being shown. What I find fascinating about this website is how its design perfectly showcases the severity of the sitution each animal is in. For example, when the viewer goes to click on "whats the threat?", the animal's pieces will break apart with many of the pieces being coated in red splatters which alludes to bloood and by extension the death of the animal. The music which can be turned off further sells the somber nature of this website.

    How Are You Doing? is a website that records your mood and assists in processing it through a variety of exercises. The entire website is full of wonderfull drawn illustrations that complement the subject mater perfectly. It is also highly personal, with the crator also mentioning their experiences in relation to the exercises and how it helped them.</p>
