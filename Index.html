    <p>Hiya world! This is my webpage! I hope you like it!</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2> 
    <P>My name is Xiomara Ponce! I have not coded very much before so my work is very ameteurish but I'm having fun so I think thats all that really matters! I want to be a UI/UX designer someday so getting familliar with critical web design will definitely help, hopefuuly. As for moe tidbits about myself? I'm really into anime and anything relatd to it! Gacha games, visual novels, audio dramas, if its got anime visuals I'm all over it! Well the characters and story have to be good too, of course! Speaking of stories I just adore them! I also have the hoby of drawing and writing, in my spare time. Overall I'm looking forward to see how much I can learn about this topic despite my inexperience!</P>

    <p><a href="https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/">This X Does Not Exist</a><br>
    This X Does Not Exist is a website that links to numerous other websites that will generate images of things, humans or animals that do not exist. This website is noteworthy for its use of unsophisticated Ai image generation as the websites all utilize outdated AI technology. In a sense it is a time capsule that allows the visitor to look back at a time where AI was still new and rough around the edges.</p>
    <p><a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/#">Species in Pieces</a><br>
    Species In Pieces is an informative website that ceatively showcases thirty animals in danger of extinction. Each animal is built with thirty polygonal pieces and the UI allows the viewer to learn more about the website and the animal that is currently being shown. What I find fascinating about this website is how its design perfectly showcases the severity of the sitution each animal is in. For example, when the viewer goes to click on "whats the threat?", the animal's pieces will break apart with many of the pieces being coated in red splatters which alludes to bloood and by extension the death of the animal. The music which can be turned off further sells the somber nature of this website.

    How Are You Doing? is a website that records your mood and assists in processing it through a variety of exercises. The entire website is full of wonderfull drawn illustrations that complement the subject mater perfectly. It is also highly personal, with the crator also mentioning their experiences in relation to the exercises and how it helped them.</p>
